History of OpenCV
OpenCV was started at Intel in 1999 by Gary Bradsky and the first release came out in 2000. Vadim Pisarevsky joined Gary Bradsky to manage Intelâ€™s Russian software OpenCV team. In 2005, OpenCV was used on Stanley, the vehicle who won 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge. Later its active development continued under the support of Willow Garage, with Gary Bradsky and Vadim Pisarevsky leading the project. Right now, OpenCV supports a lot of algorithms related to Computer Vision and Machine Learning and it is expanding day-by-day.

Currently OpenCV supports a wide variety of programming languages like C++, Python, Java etc and is available on different platforms including Windows, Linux, OS X, Android, iOS etc. Also, interfaces based on CUDA and OpenCL are also under active development for high-speed GPU operations.

OpenCV-Python is the Python API of OpenCV. It combines the best qualities of OpenCV C++ API and Python language.

OpenCV-Python
Compared to other languages like C/C++, Python is slower. But another important feature of Python is that it can be easily extended with C/C++. This feature helps us to write computationally intensive codes in C/C++ and create a Python wrapper for it so that we can use these wrappers as Python modules. This gives us two advantages: first, our code is as fast as original C/C++ code (since it is the actual C++ code working in background) and second, it is very easy to code in Python. This is how OpenCV-Python works, it is a Python wrapper around original C++ implementation.

Installing OpenCV
pip install opencv-contrib-python

pip install opencv-python

```
